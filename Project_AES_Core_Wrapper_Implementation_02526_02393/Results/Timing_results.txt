Timing results:

	Setup Timing:
	
	Worst Negative Slack (WNS): inf
	Total Negative Slack (TNS): 0.000 ns
	Number of Failing Endpoints: 0
	Total Number of Endpoints: 12,268
	
	Hold Timing:
		
	Worst Hold Slack (WHS): inf
	Total Hold Slack (THS): 0.000 ns
	Number of Failing Endpoints: 0
	Total Number of Endpoints: 12,268
	
	Pulse Width:
	
	Worst Pulse Width Slack (WPWS): NA
	Total Pulse Width Negative Slack (TPWS): NA
	Number of Failing Endpoints: NA
	Total Number of Endpoints: NA
	
	Timing Constraints:
		
	The design does not include user-specified timing constraints.
